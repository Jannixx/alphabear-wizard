# alphabear-wizard
This is a word generator for the awesome alphabear Android App.

To run the very first version, check out the project and find the class "Runner" in package org.jannikks.alphabear.wizard.run. Type in your board configuration in the main method and run as java program.

Known issues:
* no user interface :)
* the algorithm does not work optimally on duplicate letters with the same number of turns left.
